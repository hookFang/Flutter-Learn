# Learn Flutter

A new Flutter project. All the new code which I have completed are added into separate branches.
You can pull these branches to test these code and learn :)

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
These resources below are better than any other tutorials I have watched, these guide you step by step and explains every single piece of code

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Small Projects Completed So far 

- ##Added a Stopwatch UI to the app
    ###This uses the [Stopwatch class](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.10.5/dart-core/Stopwatch-class.html), View [File](https://github.com/hookFang/flutter_learn/blob/master/lib/stopwatch.dart) on the Repo.
